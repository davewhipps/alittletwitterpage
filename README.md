==================

A Little Twitter Page, fun with the Twitter API.

First... the bad news
------------------------

Here's a quick list of the things that I should have done, but didn't get around to:

0. Templated views. I hate my use of script templating. So ugly.
1. Combined and minimized all JS. (This tends to be done automatically by your backend. e.g. Rails does this nicely.)
2. Implemented and added to localstorage the other suggested options (i.e. timerange, # of tweets etc.)
3. Cleaned up the CSS (really I should have used SASS here. CSS was just quick and dirty.)
4. I realize I didn't get any "metions" in there.
5. The styling isn't up to snuff. Man have I come to rely on my designers!
6. The options should have been refactored into a view.
7. Lots more cross-browser testing.


Now... the good news
------------------------

1. Good use of existing libraries: Backbone (nice MVC), Underscore, jQuery (localstorage, ui-sortable)
2. Drag-drop sortable.
